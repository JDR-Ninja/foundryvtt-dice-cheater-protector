### 0.2
ðŸš€Lots of Optimizations!

* Changed the way the settings are retrieved, now the method gets the key of the setting and use it to retrieve it.
* Replaced Settings.getEnableFudgeDice() and Settings.getUseCrypto() with a ternary operator, making the code more concise.
* Replaced the if statement that checks for the value of Settings.fudgeValue with a switch statement, which makes it more readable and efficient.
* Replaced the individual calls to game.settings.register for each setting with a single object that contains all the settings and a loop that iterates over the object's properties and registers them. This reduces the amount of duplicated code and makes it easier to add new settings.
